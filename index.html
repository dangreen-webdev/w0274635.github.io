            <p class="maincontent">My name is Dan Green, and I am a front-end web developer based in Halifax, Nova Soctia.
        I am currently studying web development at the NSCC Institute of Technology Campus. </p>

            <p class="maincontent"> I decided to pursue a career in IT
                because technology is the way of the future. Everything
                is shifting towards digital and having an online
                presense is essential for any business to be successful
                these days. I find this shift in times exciting having
                been someone who has always been interested in technology
                and the Internet. I have always found it fascinating by how much
                 of an impact modern day computing enhances the ability for society to function.
            </p>

                <p class="maincontent">
                 I also have a very creative mind and
                willingness to learn which comes in very
                useful when it comes to developing web pages and finding solutions to arising difficulties
                within the code that I write.
                and every day.</p>
