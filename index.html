            <p class="maincontent">My name is Dan Green, and I am a front-end web developer based in Halifax, Nova Soctia.
        I am currently studying web development at the NSCC Institute of Technology Campus. </p>

            <p class="maincontent"> I decided to pursue a career in IT
                because I have always had an interest in the internet.

                I am a very creative thinker
               which is
                useful when it comes to developing web pages and solving problems
                within the code that I write.
                    <br>
                <br>
                On my web page, you will find information about me such as samples of my work, my skills, my resume, etc.. Feel free to have a look around.
                Do not hesitate to contact me should you require more info or if you would like to get in touch.
            </p>
