        <h1 class="mainheader">My Goals</h1>

        <h2 class="maincontent">Short Term Goals:</h2>

        <p class="maincontent">My main goal over the next year is to find a work placement for this upcoming
        summer. A requirement of the IT Web Development program is we are required to find an IT business or company
        to work for a term and gain some experience of what it is like to work in the industry. I am hoping
        to find a good solid place to work to start my career off on the right path. </p>

        <p class="maincontent">I would like to work on my networking skills over the next while and try and meet
        more people in the industry and get my name out there. I have been told by multiple people who have already
        had success in the IT industry that networking is a crucial part in landing a good position.</p>

        <p class="maincontent">Getting involved in some of the extra programs at school is another thing that
        I have been planning on getting involved in. There are lots of different things I could get involved
        in around the school that I could benefit from and it would look great on a resume.</p>

        <p class="maincontent">Another goal of mine is to become better at client side programming. So far
        I have been mostly writing programs and running them through Node, but I would like to eventually
        be able to fully integrate Javascript into my web pages to make them do cool things. </p>

        <p class="maincontent">Lastly, I would like to learn the fundamentals of as many coding languages
        as possible over the next year or so. I find learning new coding languages very exciting. It would give
            me the ability to do more things with my projects. </p>


        <h2 class="maincontent">Long Term Goals:</h2>

        <p class="maincontent">My main long term goal is the reason why I decided to attend NSCC in the first
        place, and that is to find a well-paying job doing something I enjoy. After my my first
            full semester I am loving it. I think this is a very attainable
        goal if I stick with it and put the effort it.</p>

        <p class="maincontent">Designing and creating mobile apps is another thing I have always been
        interested in and wanted to get into. After finishing the program I should have the basic skills
        neccessary to get started on working towards creating my very own apps. </p>

        <p class="maincontent">Having always been a fan of the television show Dragon's Den, it has always been
        a long time goal of mine to some day start my own business. This is something that wouldn't happen
        until later in my career after getting some industry experience but nonetheless is something
        I really hope I can make happen evetually. </p>

        <p class="maincontent">Another goal of mine is to become better at client side programming. So far
            I have been mostly writing programs and running them through Node, but I would like to eventually
            be able to fully integrate Javascript into my web pages to make them do cool things. </p>

        <p class="maincontent">Lastly, I would like to learn the fundamentals of as many coding languages
            as possible over the next year or so. I find learning new coding languages very exciting. It would give
